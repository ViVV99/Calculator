# Calculator
Calculator using CSS, HTML and JavaScript

- There's no much to say, it's a calculator, you put numbers and operatins and then press '=' and yeah.

- PS: There do are some bugs, and I know that all the code could be greatly optmized if I used RegEx, and I'm going to resolve all of those problems with time, but for now I belive it's a acceptable "beta" version.
